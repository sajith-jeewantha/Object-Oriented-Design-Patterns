# Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns
Software Development is like putting together a puzzle. `Object-oriented programming (OOP)` is a popular way to build complex software, but it can be tricky when you face the same design problems repeatedly. That’s where design patterns come in.

`Design patterns` are like well-known recipes for `common problems` in software development. They’re not step-by-step instructions, but more like guidelines to help you solve these problems in a `flexible` and `efficient` way. These patterns gather the wisdom of the software development community, making it easier for developers to work together and create software that’s easy to `maintain, adapt and reuse`.

## Important Topics for the Design patterns in object-oriented programming

* Singleton Design Pattern
